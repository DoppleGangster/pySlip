Release 4.0 of pySlip has the following changes:

1. Uses wxPython 4.0.

2. Uses python 3.6.

2. A more streamlined way to define tile sources.

3. Additional tile source modules:
     Blue Marble tiles          (bm_tiles.py)
     Stamen Toner tiles         (stmt_tiles.py)
     Stamen Transport tiles     (stmtr_tiles.py)
     Stamen Watercolor tiles    (stmw_tiles.py)

4. A method of changing the tile source for an existing pySlip instance.
   See the API documentation for more details.  The examples/pyslip_demo.py
   program has been extended to exercise this new functionality.

5. A mechanism to update tiles sourced from a server.  See the API
   documentation for details on managing this feature.

Warnings:

The OpenStreetMap tile servers seem to not work for me.

The code to handle connecting through a proxy has NOT been tested.

The built in GMT tiles are not at the same zoom level as the internet tiles.
This may change in the future.
