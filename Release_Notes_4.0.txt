Release 4.0 of pySlip has the following changes:

1. Uses wxPython 4.0.

2. Uses python 3.6.

2. A more streamlined way to define tile sources.

3. Additional tile source modules:
     Blue Marble tiles          (blue_marble.py)
     Stamen Toner tiles         (stamen_toner.py)
     Stamen Transport tiles     (stamen_transport.py)
     Stamen Watercolor tiles    (stamen_watercolor.py)
   See note about OpenStreetMap tiles below.

4. A method of changing the tile source for an existing pySlip instance.
   See the API documentation for more details.  The examples/pyslip_demo.py
   program has been extended to exercise this new functionality.

5. A mechanism to update tiles sourced from a server.  See the API
   documentation for details on managing this feature.

Warnings:

The OpenStreetMap tile servers seem to not work for me.  Getting 429 errors
implying that I'm getting tiles too quickly, but it happens on the FIRST tile
fetch!?

The built in GMT tiles are not at the same zoom level as the internet tiles.
This may change in the future.
