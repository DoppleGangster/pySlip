Release 3.0 of pySlip has some changes that adversely affect existing code:

1. The pySlip() constructor has a slight change to its signature.  This is to
   handle different tile sources.

2. The selection event EVT_PYSLIP_SELECT has changed considerably.

See the API documentation for the details.
