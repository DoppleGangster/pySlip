Release 3.0 of pySlip has some changes that adversely affect existing code:

1. The pySlip() constructor has a slight change to its signature.  This is to
   handle different tile sources.

2. A change to the attributes of the EVT_PYSLIP_SELECT event.  This was done to
   handle problems raised by box selection of polygons.

See the API documentation for the details.
