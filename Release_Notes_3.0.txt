Release 3.0 of pySlip has some changes that adversely affect
existing users:

1. The pySlip() constructor has had its signature change.  This is to handle
   different tile sources.

2. A new pySlip event is added: EVT_PYSLIP_BOXSELECT.  This was done to
   handle problems raised by box selection of polygons.  The EVT_PYSLIP_SELECT
   event now handles only single selection of objects in one layer.

See the API documentation for the details.
