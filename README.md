# pySlip
pySlip is a 'slip map' widget for wxPython.

**This is the GitHub version of the Google Code pySlip project.
The 2.X versions of code will remain on Google.
The 3.X versions will be developed here on GitHub.**

During my work writing geophysical applications in python I often wanted to display a map that was very large - many hundreds of thousands of pixels in width.  I searched around for a GUI solution that would work rather like Google maps: tiled, layers, etc.  I couldn't find anything that didn't assume browser+map server.  So I wrote my own wxPython widget.

It's a poor thing, but solves my problem.  I'm placing it here in the hope that someone else may find it useful.  If you find it useful, or make improvements to it, drop me a line.

pySlip works on Linux, Mac and Windows.
